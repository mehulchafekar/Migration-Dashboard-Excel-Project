Migration shapes the cultural and economic landscape of nations, influencing everything from workforce dynamics to social integration. By analyzing migration trends, we can better understand the movement of people across borders and the factors driving these shifts

## Objective of the Migration Dashboard:

The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and visual representation of international migration data. Specifically, it aims to:

**Analyze Migration Trends**: Present insights into migration patterns by gender, age group, and travel history, helping users understand who is migrating and under what circumstances.

**Track Visa Issuance**: Visualize the distribution of different types of visas (Student, Work, Visitor, Resident) to understand the purpose behind migration.

**Highlight Key Countries**: Identify the top countries contributing to migration flows and examine the geographical patterns of migration.

**Understand Special Factors**: Track unique factors, such as the number of migrants traveling with pets, to give a fuller picture of migration conditions.

**Monitor Migration Volume**: Display the total number of migrants, broken down by finalized and provisional data, to give an up-to-date overview of migration flows.
